# BASIC STATIC CELL AUTOMATION

### Very important !!
Obv the cells wont keep on automating, it will just automate until one generation and stop becase skill issue.

Also very basic rules for cells being dead or alive again bcz skill issue


### Language used
Obv python cause less pain.


### Rules
1. A cell can be either 0 (dead) or 1 (alive)
2. For nth cell if anyone of its right or left neighbour is alive:
   It will turn to 1 if it was 0
   It will remain 1 if it was already 1
3. Otherwise cell dies (turns to 0)


### Note
--> index 0 cell and index -1 cell are also neighbours


### Apologies
Apologies if my way of writing rules is not in a standard form, I am still learning how to write all these readme's and docs.
